# Ravenhyde-SlightlyEasierCombat
A Stardew Valley mod to make combat a hair easier.

This mod makes combat a slight bit easier by reducing monsters' health stats by 10%. Requires Content Patcher and Stardew Valley 1.6 or greater.

Installing:
Copy the "[CP] RavensEasierCombat" folder to your mods folder.

Known Issues:
The mod patches the English-language Data/Monsters file; each language has its own Data/Monsters language-specific file and so the mod currently does not patch non-English games.

To-do:
As time permits, I hope to produce versions specific to each language, but I make no promises.
